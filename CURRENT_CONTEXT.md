# Decades Bar - Current Context & Active Session
*Last Updated: 12/17/2025, 09:08 PM*

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Updating app branding to match the "DECADES" logo aesthetics.
- Ensuring the new thin geometric font preserves the premium Gold effect.

## 🛠 Recent Changes
- Updated branding font to **"Outfit"** (Extra Light 200) across Header, Sidebar, and Welcome sections.
- Increased letter spacing and adjusted sizing for a more "Cinematic" and logo-consistent look.
- Preserved the cinematic gold gradient effect on the new thinner font weights.

## 🚧 Active Roadblocks & Issues
- None

## 📝 Recent Technical Decisions
- Switched from a single growing memory file to a dual-layered approach for better LLM context window management.
- Structural context is kept static/long-term, while active context is dynamic and session-based.
