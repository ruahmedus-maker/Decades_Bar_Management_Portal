PROJECT: Decades Bar Training Portal (15-20 users, bar staff management)
STATUS: Halfway through localStorage → Supabase migration

CURRENT FOCUS: Fix progress tracking system

TEST USERS (one-click login):
• bartender@decadesbar.com / password123
• trainee@decadesbar.com / password123  
• admin@decadesbar.com / admin123

IMMEDIATE ISSUES:
1. Progress UI shows but doesn't track visits (ProgressSection.tsx)
2. Test section needs content structure (TestSection.tsx)
3. Deployment shows "Loading..." after updates (cache issue?)

RECENT WORK:
• Removed Quick Setup button, kept 3 test credential buttons
• Confirmed user_progress table exists with correct schema
• Created this chat memory system

KEY FILES:
• ProgressSection.tsx (broken tracking)
• progress.ts + supabase-progress.ts (progress logic)
• LoginBarrier.tsx (✅ working auth)

ENV VAR NEEDED: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTS=true
